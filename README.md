## [Path Prefix](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/path-prefix/)

As the blog is hosted under /blog to simulate a "prod" like environment path prefixing is required.

Use the following commands to check that things are working as expected. The pathPrefix is defined in `gatsby-config.js`.

```shell
gatsby build --prefix-paths
```

```shell
gatsby serve --prefix-paths
```
